# Hey, I’m Marcos Cipriano (@saintcip)

Product Manager with UX and design leadership at [SHARP](https://sharpstudiollc.com/), based in Los Angeles. I turn complex ideas into clear systems and shipped digital products by blending product thinking, design craft, and technical fluency.

Over the past four years, I’ve led product delivery, UX strategy, and project execution across web platforms, SaaS tools, internal systems, and creative technology initiatives. Originally from Brazil with Italian roots, I now partner with founders, startups, and creative teams to translate raw ideas into polished, scalable digital experiences.

## What I focus on
- **Product delivery & UX strategy:** Guiding teams from discovery through launch, aligning stakeholders, and keeping execution disciplined.
- **Systems-first workflows:** Structuring roadmaps, design systems, and operational playbooks that make complex products legible.
- **Visual & technical fluency:** Marrying a strong visual background with practical technical understanding to prototype, communicate, and ship.
